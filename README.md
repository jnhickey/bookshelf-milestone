Team,

Great job so far on the app.  The client has really liked what we have shown them in the demos.
Now it's time to make our Bookshelf app interactive so that the librarians can start learning to
navigate the new system, test it, and provide us more direct feedback.  To do this, we need to add 
a couple more features, outlined in the tabs below. Submit the link to your GitHub repo when you're
finished and, as always, the help desk is open.
